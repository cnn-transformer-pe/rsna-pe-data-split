# PEFormer: CNN-Transformer Network withNoisy Training for Robust Pulmonary EmbolismDetection in Computed Tomography
## Dataset Split
We make our data split for the RSNA STR Pulmonary Embolism [1] dataset public for reproducability. We split the original training set such that 80% is for training and 20% is for testing. We ensure no patient overlap between the two sets.
